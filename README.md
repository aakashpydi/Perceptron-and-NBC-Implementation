## Perceptron and Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation
#### Aakash Pydi
---
### Usage Instructions
---

There are three python scripts in this project. They are,
1. vanilla.py --> Implements a vanilla perceptron classifier
2. avg.py --> Implements an average perceptron classifier
3. nbc.py --> Implements a naive bayes classifier

The scripts take the following arguments,
* trainingDataFile --> corresponds to  a subset of the Yelp dataset that is used as the training set
* testingDataFile --> corresponds to another subset of the Yelp data that is used as the test set
* maxIterations --> The perceptron models (vanilla.py and avg.py), take an additional parameter corresponding to the maximum number of iterations it should run.
